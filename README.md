# School
This is a project to manage students info, it's a microservice project that allows us to save information about students and we can know which course is assigned thanks to microservices.

to run the project we have to have installed java 11 and MySQL, create a database named home_depot_school and we can run it.
If  we want to use the "/studentWithCourse/{id}" path, we need to download the Courses project and run it first.
